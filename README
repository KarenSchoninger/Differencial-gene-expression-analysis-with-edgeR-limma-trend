Differential Expression Analysis with edgeR & limma-trend

**This repository contains an R script to perform differential expression analysis using the edgeR and limma-trend libraries.**

## Description

The provided R script performs differential expression analysis using the edgeR and limma-trend packages. Through this analysis, genes that are differentially expressed under different experimental conditions are identified.

## Files

- `analisis_expresion_differential.R`: The R script that contains differential expression analysis using edgeR and limma-trend.
- `RSEM_counts.txt`: File of gene expression counts.
- `samples.txt`: File with sample information.
- `samples_edgeR.txt`: File with additional information about the samples.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have R installed on your system.
2. Download the files for gene expression counts (`RSEM_counts.txt`), sample information (`samples.txt`), and sample details (`samples_edgeR.txt`).
3. Open the `differential_expression_analysis.R` script in RStudio or another R environment.
4. Run the script to perform differential expression analysis.

## Results

The results of the differential expression analysis are stored in three text files:

- `AO_DE.txt`: Adjusted results for the "Activity Onset" effect.
- `Sex_DE.txt`: Adjusted results for the "Sex" effect.
- `AO_Sex_DE.txt`: Adjusted results for the interaction between "Activity Onset" and "Sex".

## Grades

- Make sure the file paths in the script are set correctly for your system.
- The R packages needed for analysis must be installed. If they are not, use `install.packages("package_name")` to install them.
